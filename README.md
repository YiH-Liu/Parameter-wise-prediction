# Parameter-wise-prediction
This repository contains several Julia codes associated with "Parameter-wise predictions for random walk-based models" by Yihan Liu, David J. Warne, and Matthew J. Simpson. The preprint is available at 

# Case1
 This file contains three sub-files: Data, AdditiveGaussian, and Multinomial.
## Data from Case1
 DiscreteModel.jl is responsible for generating all data needed to create Figure 2(a)-(d) and generate result for both the additive Gaussian measurement error model and the multinomial measurement error model. Figure2a-d.jl is responsible for creating Figure 2(a)-(d) using the data.
## AdditiveGaussian from Case1
 AdditiveGaussian.jl is used to generate the results for the additive Gaussian measurement error model for Case 1 using the data generated in DiscreteModel.jl.
## Multinomial from Case1
 Multinomial.jl is used to generate the results for the multinomial measurement error model for Case 1 using the data generated in DiscreteModel.jl.
