# Case1
 This file contains four sub-files: Data1, Data2, Analysis1 and Analysis2.
## Data1 from Case1
 DiscreteModel.jl is responsible for generating all synthetic data from discrete model at k=100.
 solutions.jl s responsible for generating all data from PDE model at k=100.
 Plot.jl is responsible for generating Figure 2 and Figure S1 uisng data generated from DiscreteModel.jl and solutions.jl.
## Data2 from Case1
 DiscreteModel.jl is responsible for generating all synthetic data from discrete model at k=200.
 solutions.jl s responsible for generating all data from PDE model at k=200.
 Plot.jl is responsible for generating Figure S4 uisng data generated from DiscreteModel.jl and solutions.jl.
## Analysis1 from Case1  
 Possion.jl is used to generate Figure 4 using the count data generated in DiscreteModel.jl in Data1.
## Analysis2 from Case1  
 Possion.jl is used to generate Figure S5 using the count data generated in DiscreteModel.jl in Data2.
